# Multithreaded Web Server â€“ Performance Testing with JMeter
A Java-based HTTP web server capable of handling multiple concurrent client connections through both single-threaded and multithreaded architectures.
Designed and implemented socket programming for client-server communication and built a thread pool to manage request handling efficiently.

Key Features:
Custom thread pool implementation for improved concurrency
Handles HTTP requests and simulates a basic REST-like structure
Performance and load testing done using Apache JMeter
Tested under multiple client simulations for stress analysis


Tech Stack:
Languages: Java
Concepts: Multithreading, Socket Programming, Thread Pools
Tools: Apache JMeter, IntelliJ IDEA



Performance Testing (JMeter)
Simulated up to 100+ concurrent users
Measured response time and throughput under load
Analyzed server stability and memory usage patterns
Identified edge cases like request timeouts and thread starvation


Outcomes:
Validated scalability of multithreaded server using JMeter scripts
Measured performance metrics (response time, throughput)
Gained deep insights into backend behavior under load
